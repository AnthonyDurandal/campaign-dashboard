## Data-Driven Marketing Campaign Optimization Dashboard

This is a marketing campaign data analysis practice using the **kaggle dataset([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sinderpreet/analyze-the-marketing-spending/data])**:

I used postgresql as a database because the SQL language used in Amazon Redshift is very similar to PostgreSQL.
